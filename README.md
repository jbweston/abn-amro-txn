# abn-amro-txn

A library for processing bank statements from ABN Amro.

**here be dragons**: This project is mainly a personal experiment for practicing
                     the development workflow for a Haskell project, and to become
                     more familiar with common libraries (e.g. Megaparsec for parsing).
                     **I do not recommend using this for anything serious**.
